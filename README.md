## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the attrition rate of drivers working with Ola, based on various features such as age, income, education level, city, and performance metrics. The project leverages several machine learning models, including **Random Forest**, **Gradient Boosting**, and **XGBoost**. These models are combined using **Voting Classifier** to improve accuracy.

### Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Categorical encoding, feature scaling, and handling missing values.
- **Ensemble Learning:** Combining multiple models for better performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing models using GridSearchCV.
- **Model Deployment:** A web application for predicting driver attrition using **Streamlit**.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy** - Mathematical operations.
- **scikit-learn** - Machine learning models and preprocessing.
- **xgboost** - Extreme Gradient Boosting.
- **joblib** - Saving and loading models.
- **streamlit** - For building the web app.
- **imbalanced-learn** - For handling class imbalance using SMOTE.
  
## Dataset

The dataset consists of the following columns:

- `no_of_reportings`: Number of reportings for the driver.
- `Age`: Age of the driver.
- `Gender`: Gender of the driver.
- `Grade`: Grade of the driver.
- `Total Business Value`: Business value generated by the driver.
- `Income`: Income of the driver.
- `Quarterly Rating`: Rating given to the driver quarterly.
- `joining_month`: Month in which the driver joined.
- `joining_year`: Year in which the driver joined.
- `quarterly_rating_raise`: Quarterly rating raise.
- `Income_raised`: Raised income.
- `Education_Level_1`, `Education_Level_2`: One-hot encoded columns for education level.
- `City_*`: One-hot encoded columns for city.
  
The target column, `target`, indicates whether the driver has churned (0) or not (1).

## Modeling Process

The goal is to predict whether a driver will churn or not, using a classification model. Here's the process:

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values.
   - Encode categorical variables using **LabelEncoder** and **One-Hot Encoding**.
   - Standardize numerical features using **StandardScaler**.

2. **Modeling:**
   - Train individual models: **Random Forest**, **Gradient Boosting**, and **XGBoost**.
   - Use **Voting Classifier** for ensemble learning.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning using **GridSearchCV** to optimize the models.
   - Choose the best models based on their performance metrics.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate models using **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **classification report**.

5. **Saving Models:**
   - Save the trained models, scaler, label encoder, and one-hot encoded columns using **joblib** for easy loading during deployment.

## Preprocessing

The preprocessing steps are as follows:

1. **Label Encoding**: The `Gender` column is encoded using LabelEncoder.
2. **One-Hot Encoding**: The `Education_Level` and `City` columns are one-hot encoded.
3. **Standardization**: The following columns are standardized using **StandardScaler**: `Age`, `Income`, `Total Business Value`, `Quarterly Rating`.
4. **Handling Class Imbalance**: SMOTE is used to handle the class imbalance in the dataset.

## Ensemble Learning Models

We have used the following models in the ensemble:

1. **Random Forest Classifier**
2. **Gradient Boosting Classifier**
3. **XGBoost Classifier**

The predictions from all models are combined using a **Voting Classifier**.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

Hyperparameter tuning is performed using **GridSearchCV** to find the best parameters for each of the models, thus improving their performance.

## Deployment

The model is deployed as a **Streamlit** web application. Users can input driver information, and the app will predict whether the driver will churn or not.
